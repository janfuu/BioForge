        // it was a toggle the user only ever got wrong.
        //

        // large hall like the Blue Palace is covered with no radius to tune).

        // uGridsToLoad. The engine keeps a uGrids x uGrids cell window around
        // the player (5x5 by default, 20480 units across) and unloads
        // everything else, in EVERY worldspace - the walled cities included.
        // Actors outside that window are not in memory at all, and
        // ForEachReferenceInRange can only return what is loaded. So at the
        // default uGrids the farthest an actor can POSSIBLY be is ~17400 units
        // (the window's corner-to-corner diagonal), no matter what this says.

        // out at 8429 and Solitude at 9959 - neither was radius-limited. The
        // tell was that scan counts change as the player walks, because the
        // window slides and swaps which actors exist.
